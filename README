The purpose of the DrmLicenseService is to provide an easy way of getting DRM licenses for different DRM solutions.

Master branch holds solution for MediaDrm framework, prefered solution for devices released on L cookie.
For opendrmframework use alternative branches.

DrmLicenseService will perform all communication with server to acquire license and may, depending on the way it is started, provide progress information.

Ways to start DrmLicenseService:
Use AIDL to renew rights or start handling of a PlayReady WebInitiator.
Provides progress feedback using AIDL callback interface.
This is the preferred way of launching DrmLicenseService.

Notes on Version 01.070.0002:
We reconsidered the license acquisition via file because Google changed storage access policy from N.
